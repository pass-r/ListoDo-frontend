# DuNau (Frontend)
## Todo app - Frontend built with React

This is the frontend for a Todo App built using React, which interacts with an API I developed in a separate project (see repository [dunau-backend](https://github.com/pass-r/dunau-backend)).

## Name

**DuNau** is a play on the phrase **"Do Now"**.


## Features

- View, create, edit and delete Tasks.
- Optimistic UI updated using React hooks.
- Task data is fetched from the backend API.


## Tools & Technologies:

- React
- JavaScript
- API Integration: Communicates with a backend API to manage the tasks


## Backend

- Backend repository: [dunau-backend](https://github.com/pass-r/dunau-backend)

- **Note:** Currently, tasks are stored **in memory** for each user, so they will be lost when the server restarts.
